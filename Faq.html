        <h1>Detail Question and Answers on COVID-19 for Public</h1>
        What is corona virus
        <p>
            orona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
            in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
            to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
            severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
            and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
            discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
        </p>

        What is COVID-19
        <p>
            COVID-19  is  the  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  most  recently
            discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
            before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
        </p>

        What are the symptoms of COVID-19

        <p>
            he most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
            dry  cough.  Some  patients  may  have  aches  and  pains,  nasal
            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most  people (about
            80%)  recover  from  the  disease  without  needing  special  treatment.
            Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
            ill  and  develops  difficulty  breathing.  Older  people,  and  those  with
            underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,  heart problems
            or  diabetes, are  more  likely to  develop serious  illness.  People  with
            fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical  attention.
        </p>

        How does COVID-19 spread

        <p>
            People  can  catch  COVID-19  from  others  who  have  the  virus.  The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
            the  person.  Other  people  then  catch  COVID-19  by  touching  these
            objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  People
            can also catch  COVID-19  if they breathe  in  droplets  from a  person
            with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
            important  to  stay  more  than  1  meter  (3  feet)  away  from  a person
            who is sick.
